Time Log
<br />
### Week 1: 2 hours 
Thought about my project plan a lot mostly tried to narrow down a topic. I had 
the general idea of creating the habit tracker. I want to make it more fun or even 
game like but have not identified exactly what that is. 
### Week 2: 2 hours
Didn't have a lot of time this week so I mostly created the repository and did some
research on existing habit tracking applications. I took some screenshots just as references of layouts
that I liked. I also identified a few user goals that way I can decide on user stories and things like 
that down the road. I also decided that I wanted to use the Poke API to get pokemon information and 
reward users with Pokemon when completing goals. I was sick for a lot of this week. It kind of put me 
behind and I am trying to catch up. 
### Week 3: 10 hours 
I did almost all of the work for the checkpoint 1. This includes creating the user stories, the
 work flow, creating wire frames, refining my problem statement, and creating the project plan. On top of 
 the weekly assignment this was a lot of work to do before the check point all at once. Although I was
 able to complete all of this I need to try to stick to my project plan in the future. It will be a lot 
 more manageable in increments. The hardest part to plan out by far was the project plan it is hard to know
 exactly what I will be doing especially on topics that we have not yet covered in class. I tried to 
 follow the Fat Bike Trail Reports and just apply that to my own application. I think the hardest part is 
 know what databases tables and structure I will have since I have not fleshed out all the details of what
 I am going to include as far as pokemon go and if it will be smarter to split some things up some more. I 
 will work this out the next week as I only thought this through enough to get through the project plan.
