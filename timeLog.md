Time Log
<br />
### Week 1: 2 hours 
Thought about my project plan a lot mostly tried to narrow down a topic. I had 
the general idea of creating the habit tracker. I want to make it more fun or even 
game like but have not identified exactly what that is. 
### Week 2: 2 hours
Didn't have a lot of time this week so I mostly created the repository and did some
research on existing habit tracking applications. I took some screenshots just as references of layouts
that I liked. I also identified a few user goals that way I can decide on user stories and things like 
that down the road. I also decided that I wanted to use the Poke API to get pokemon information and 
reward users with Pokemon when completing goals. I was sick for a lot of this week. It kind of put me 
behind and I am trying to catch up. 
### Week 3: 10 hours 
I did almost all of the work for the checkpoint 1. This includes creating the user stories, the
 work flow, creating wire frames, refining my problem statement, and creating the project plan. On top of 
 the weekly assignment this was a lot of work to do before the check point all at once. Although I was
 able to complete all of this I need to try to stick to my project plan in the future. It will be a lot 
 more manageable in increments. The hardest part to plan out by far was the project plan it is hard to know
 exactly what I will be doing especially on topics that we have not yet covered in class. I tried to 
 follow the Fat Bike Trail Reports and just apply that to my own application. I think the hardest part is 
 know what databases tables and structure I will have since I have not fleshed out all the details of what
 I am going to include as far as pokemon go and if it will be smarter to split some things up some more. I 
 will work this out the next week as I only thought this through enough to get through the project plan. 

###Week 4 4 hours
Finished up work for checkpoint 1. 
Began the work to implement hibernate into my personal project. Was able to get this set up and the entities User and role
I didn't however finish all the unit testing and the mapping of relationships between the enitities. 
###Week 5 0 hours

### Week 6 9 hours
Implemented the user authentication. This required finishing up everything from the relationship mapping between the two entities
### Week 7 6 hours
Worked on creating my databases and my entities for the checkpoint 2. Implemented log4j. I wasn't able to complete the 
full hibernate annotations on my entities as well as the unit testing. 
### Week 8 8 hours
Worked on deploying my application to AWS. Did not quite get there I got the step 5 of the instructions but did not do the 
actual deployment. I have a lot of test failures that are preventing me from building the war file and actually putting it out 
to AWSFinished up the deployment. Worked on completing requirements for checkpoint 3. This meant making sure my application was deployed to AWS, 
had the authentication working properly and was displaying some user data on the jsp. 
### Week 9 0 hours
Didn't complete much as I prepared for the professional development presentation. 
### Week 10 5 hours
Worked mostly on the group project. Created the API client for the Poke API.

### Week 12
Finished all the database mappings and added additional unit tests. I also finished the API integration and did the json mapping
to java using robopojo generator. 
### Week 13 14 hours
Worked on the front end mostly this week. Not too many hiccups here once I got a template working everything
else went pretty smoothly 
### Week 14 20 hours
Added functionality and controllers to display goals. This week was a lot of clean up and reconfiguring just to get things working. 
I left a lot for the end so I am definitely still working on getting the basic crud completely finished. 
### Week 15  20 hours
I still had a lot of functionality to finish. Made sure i was able to do full crud on the application. Had to add logic 
to hiding and showing the pokemon.  Which meant also updating the goal entity to have an indicator. Added a few new servlets
implemented some validation. Also worked on implementing feedback from the last code review. Finish the presentation, final touches,
and screen recording.
