Time Log
<br />
Week 1: 2 hours 
Thought about my project plan a lot mostly tried to narrow down a topic. I had 
the general idea of creating the habit tracker. I want to make it more fun or even 
game like but have not identified exactly what that is. 
Week 2: 2 hours
Didn't have a lot of time this week so I mostly created the repository and did some
reasearch on existing habit tracking applications. I took some screenshots. I also identiied
a few user goals that way I can decide on user stories and things like that down the road.
Week 3: 10 hours 
I did almost all of the work for the checkpoint 1. This includes creating the user storeis, the
 work flow, creating wire frames, refining my problem statement.
